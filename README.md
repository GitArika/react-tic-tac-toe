## About

That's a simple app implemented following [this](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial.

Also i've implemented the advanced features suggested by react org. 

* :heavy_check_mark: Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.

* :heavy_check_mark: Bold the currently selected item in the move list.

* :heavy_check_mark: Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.

* :heavy_check_mark: When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

* :heavy_check_mark: Add the button to re-start the game.

* :heavy_check_mark: When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

* :heavy_check_mark: Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
